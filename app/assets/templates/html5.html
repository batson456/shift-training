				<h3>What is HTML 5</h3>
				<p>When HTML was first designed, it was meant to display primarily static content. Just like newspapers, the web was a place for information, and that is about it. Internet speeds limited what developers could produce almost as much as the technology at hand. As the web continued to grow, and internet speeds increased, designers and developers were able to squeeze out more and more out of their designs, providing users with increasingly interactive and dynamic experiences. This new dynamic web became known as "Web 2.0".</p>

				<p>HTML 5 is the latest version of HTML. Although it is still currently under development, many browsers have begun implementing many of the features and API's that HTML 5 provides. When it releases, it will be the first version of HTML released in over 15 years, the most recent prior being HTML 4 in 1997. Amongst a litany of other features and enhancements, HTML 5 also seeks to provide a seemless interface between mobile and desktop browsers, as many features are designed to run on lower powered devices.</p>

				<h3>New Tags</h3>
				<p>HTML 5 adds a whole bunch of new tags and some new concepts to web development that are pretty exciting. HTML 5 offers a bunch of new markup tags, along with some really cool new tags for implementing new multimedia API's</p>

				<h5>Multimedia</h5>
				<p><code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> are just a few of the tags added in that allow easier implementation of multimedia. Unfortunatley, just like everything in life, there are advantages and disadvantages to using these tags. For starters. Not all browsers have implemented these features, so you still must provide a fallback solution if you want to provide the same experience to all users of your application or website. On the other hand, for users that do have a browser supporting these features, you can provide multimedia without resorting to an external library. You no longer need to include a flash plugin to play music or videos, which can significantly increase your page load time, greatly improving your user's experience. </p>

				<h5>Markup</h5>
				<p>HTML 5 also adds a plethora of new markup tags, which in most cases replace and or supplement existing tags, providing developers with more specific ways of delivering their content; <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>. Just like the multimedia tags, these are only useful in browsers that support them, so be careful with your usage. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags are both failry self explanatory, and are often used in conjuction. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag provides a header for the page, much like the header you see on this page. You can also easily include a nav component within as follows. <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags are a little more complex, and we will go into greater detail on usage in a little bit.</p>

				<h5>API's</h5>
				<p>With HTML 5, you get access to a new set of API's that make life a little easier when designing applications. These API's are a little bit trickier to use however, and there are plenty of good tutorials on usage out there, so I am simply going to list them. (Thanks wikipedia!)</p>

				<h3>Sections / Articles / Aside</h3>
				<p><code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags are two of the more interesting tags. Like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags, they operate much like more specific <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags, but unlike <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags, they are a little less self explanatory, and using them properly is a little more tricky.</p>

				<h5>Article</h5>
				<p>An <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag is another one of those slightly tricker tags, and just like the section tag, it is not used as a styling element, but rather as a wrapper. For isntance, if you have a blog website, you would wrap the container of your blog posts in a section, and within that section, you would have multiple articles, or blog posts. Wrap each one of these blog posts in an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag. The purpose of these tags is not to replace divs, but rather to offer a solution to common symantic problems that developers face when designing an HTML document.</p>

				<h5>Aside</h5>
				<p><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tags are used to separate content that pertains to information on the page, such as a sidebar, footnotes, or annotations. For example, the following would be a common, albeit overly simplified blog website, and we will convert it into an HTML5 document.</p>

				<h5>Section</h5>
				<p>A <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag is sort of the generic fallback when none of the other tags suit a purpose. However, there is still quite a bit of confusion as to how to implement <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. From the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#the-section-element">section spec</a>, "The section element represents a generic document or application sectionâ€¦The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead." If you are not using a block for styling, but rather as a wrapper for content, a section serves this purpose quite well. For instance, breaking your page up into its own individual components, an about me section, a why us section, and a client reactions section. Each one of those sections would not fall under any sort of navigation, footer, aside, or article definition, so a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag would probably be the best fit in these cases. I will show you an example of all of these put to use in just a moment.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Some Title&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
			Some header content, logo etc...
		&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;div id=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;
			Menu and navigation inside here
		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
			&lt;div id=&quot;about_me&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h1&gt;Who Am I?&lt;/h1&gt;
				This is a little blurb about myself
			&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;blog_posts&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h1&gt;My Posts&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post&quot;&gt;Some Post&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post&quot;&gt;Some Post&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post&quot;&gt;Some Post&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;
			Some footer content
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;	
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

				<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with this approach, but it does get a little confusing at first glance to know what the purpose of each div tag is. The following would be the same markup put into an HTML5 format.</p>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;Some Title&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;header&gt;
			Some header content, logo etc...
		&lt;/header&gt;
		&lt;nav&gt;
			Menu and navigation inside here
		&lt;/nav&gt;

		&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
			&lt;section id=&quot;about_me&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h1&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h1&gt;
				This is a little blurb about myself
			&lt;/section&gt;

			&lt;section id=&quot;blog_posts&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h1&gt;My Posts&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;article&gt;Some Post&lt;/article&gt;
				&lt;article&gt;Some Post&lt;/article&gt;
				&lt;article&gt;Some Post&lt;/article&gt;
			&lt;/section&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;footer&gt;
			Some footer content
		&lt;/footer&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;	
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
				<h5>Wrapping up</h5>
				<p>Don't worry if this all seems a bit confusing at first. Bookmark the page, do some html, and come back to it later when you have a better grasp and can actually see the usefulness in these tags. Seeing as how HTML5 has not been officially adopted in all browsers, some of these tags are still not even supported. To be honest, I don't often use HTML 5 elements myself, and my computer has not (yet) started on fire. You can get away just fine without these tags while you are learning, but keep it in mind, that may change in the future.</p>
