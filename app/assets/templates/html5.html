				<h3>What is HTML 5</h3>
				<p>When HTML was first designed, it was meant to display primarily static content. Just like newspapers, the web was a place for information, and that is about it. Internet speeds limited what developers could produce almost as much as the technology at hand. As the web continued to grow, and internet speeds increased, designers and developers were able to squeeze out more and more out of their designs, providing users with increasingly interactive and dynamic experiences. This new dynamic web became known as "Web 2.0".</p>

				<p>HTML 5 is the latest version of HTML. Although it is still currently under development, many browsers have begun implementing many of the features and API's that HTML 5 provides. When it releases, it will be the first version of HTML released in over 15 years, the most recent prior being HTML 4 in 1997. Amongst a litany of other features and enhancements, HTML 5 also seeks to provide a seemless interface between mobile and desktop browsers, as many features are designed to run on lower powered devices.</p>

				<h3>New Tags</h3>
				<p>HTML 5 adds a whole bunch of new tags and some new concepts to web development that are pretty exciting. HTML 5 offers a bunch of new markup tags, along with some really cool new tags for implementing new multimedia API's</p>

				<h5>Multimedia</h5>
				<p><code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> are just a few of the tags added in that allow easier implementation of multimedia. Unfortunatley, just like everything in life, there are advantages and disadvantages to using these tags. For starters. Not all browsers have implemented these features, so you still must provide a fallback solution if you want to provide the same experience to all users of your application or website. On the other hand, for users that do have a browser supporting these features, you can provide multimedia without resorting to an external library. You no longer need to include a flash plugin to play music or videos, which can significantly increase your page load time, greatly improving your user's experience. </p>

				<h5>Markup</h5>
				<p>HTML 5 also adds a plethora of new markup tags, which in most cases replace and or supplement existing tags, providing developers with more specific ways of delivering their content; <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>. Just like the multimedia tags, these are only useful in browsers that support them, so be careful with your usage. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags are both failry self explanatory, and are often used in conjuction. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag provides a header for the page, much like the header you see on this page. You can also easily include a nav component within as follows. <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags are a little more complex, and we will go into greater detail on usage in a little bit.</p>

				<h5>API's</h5>
				<p>With HTML 5, you get access to a new set of API's that make life a little easier when designing applications. These API's are a little bit trickier to use however, and there are plenty of good tutorials on usage out there, so I am simply going to list them. (Thanks wikipedia!)</p>

				<h3>Sections / Articles</h3>
				<p><code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags are two of the more interesting tags. Like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags, they operate much like more specific <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags, but unlike <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags, they are a little less self explanatory, and using them properly is a little more tricky.</p>

				<h5>Section</h5>
				<p>A <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag does sort of what you would expect it to do. From the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#the-section-element">section spec</a>, "The section element represents a generic document or application sectionâ€¦The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead."</p>
