			<h1>Salesforce, HTML, and CSS</h1>
			<p>Although Salesforce offers a whole lot of awesome and useful tags, you don't always have to use them. In many cases, using standard HTML tags provides the same functionality. For instance, an <code>&lt;apex:outputPanel&gt;&lt;/apex:outputPanel&gt;</code> tag renders into a standard <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> tag. There are instances where using this is required, such as using it is a rerender target for an <code>&lt;apex:actionFunction&gt;&lt;/apex:actionFunction&gt;</code>, but when using it for semantic markup only, or just as a wrapper, just make use of the standard HTML counterpart. The same thing applies for <code>&lt;apex:pageBlock&gt;&lt;/apex:pageBlock&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;apex:pageblockTable&gt;&lt;/apex:pageblockTable&gt;</code>. These render into a standard HTML <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</code>. A good mixture of HTML and Visualforce tags will help make your life a little easier when the client asks for a completely custom designed Visualforce page that needs to integrate seemlessly with their website.</p>

			<p>Just remember, that like everything, there is a time and a place for all tools. Pick the right one for the job, and your life will be much easier. Visualforce tags can accelerate a lot of things, and work great when you don't mind inheriting the standard Salesforce CSS styling, or when you want to take advantage of standard Salesforce functionality. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. However, when requirements become more advanced, or if there is a lot of custom styling required, replacing a Visualforce tag with an HTML tag may make your life a little easier. These will provide you with a clean plate for styling, and will make javascript development a little easier. Overriding Salesforce styles, although possible, is not something that is easily accomplished, and is subject to pitfalls in the future in case the output of a particular Visualforce tag changes. An <code>&lt;apex:repeat&gt;&lt;/apex:repeat&gt;</code> wrapped around a table row provides a lot of the same functionality as a <code>&lt;apex:pageblockTable&gt;&lt;/apex:pageblockTable&gt;</code>, but with the ability to provide custom javascript hooks or advanced styling capabilities.</p>
